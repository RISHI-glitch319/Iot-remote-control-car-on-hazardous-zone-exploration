# Iot-remote-control-car-on-hazardous-zone-exploration
Our project introduces a Remote-Controlled Car for Hazardous Zone Exploration, designed to improve safety in mining and industrial environments. The vehicle is equipped with gas sensors capable of detecting harmful gases such as Methane (CH4) and Carbon Monoxide (CO), ensuring real-time monitoring of toxic levels.
