The proposed project introduces a Remote-Controlled Car for Hazardous Zone Exploration, specifically designed to enhance safety in mining and industrial operations where exposure to toxic gases poses significant risks to human life. The vehicle integrates advanced gas sensors capable of detecting Methane (CH4) and Carbon Monoxide (CO), two of the most common and dangerous gases in mining environments. These sensors enable real-time monitoring of toxic gas concentrations, ensuring early detection and timely alerts for preventive action.

The system employs IoT-based live data transmission, allowing continuous updates of environmental conditions to the operator at a safe distance. With command-based full control, the car can be remotely navigated through hazardous zones and rough terrains, eliminating the need for human presence in unsafe areas. Its rugged design and integrated sensing and monitoring modules ensure durability and reliability under challenging conditions.

By combining remote control, wireless communication, and real-time feedback, the car offers a robust solution for hazard detection, worker safety, and remote exploration. This innovation not only minimizes risks associated with toxic gas exposure but also supports preventive safety measures, thereby addressing critical challenges in mining, industrial safety, and hazardous environment monitoring.
